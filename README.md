select * from book_issued_counts;
```

âœ¨ 4. Data Analysis & Findings

	b.branch_id
from employee as e1
join branch as b

on e2.emp_id = b.manager_id;
```


Task 11: Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold
Filter high-value rentals.

create or replace procedure issue_book(p_issued_id varchar(10), p_member_id varchar(10), p_book_isbn varchar(30), p_emp_id varchar(10))
language plpgsql
as $$
	declare
		v_status varchar(10);
		v_title varchar(75);
	begin
		select
			status, book_title into v_status, v_title
		from books
		where isbn = p_book_isbn;

		if v_status = 'yes' then 

			insert into issued_status (issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_book_name, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
			values (p_issued_id, p_member_id, v_title, current_date, p_book_isbn, p_emp_id);

			update books
				set status = 'no'
			where isbn = p_book_isbn;

			raise notice 'Book recods add sucessfully';
